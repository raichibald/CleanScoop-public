# Clean Scoop

*Environmental game made for **Flutter Global Gamers Challenge***

## Flutter version:
`3.19.3`

## Clean app & sync dependencies:
In order to keep app in sync with pubspec.yaml, `flutter clean && flutter pub get` should be called from root
(or run `run_clean.sh` in resources/scripts)

## Building project:
`flutter run --release` (recommended for optimal performance)\
`flutter run` (debug)

**Recommended** to run on an actual *iPhone* or *iOS simulator* (*Android* is fine also :P)
